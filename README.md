# Meals-App
    This project constitutes a vanilla JavaScript application that effectively utilizes TheMealDB API for the purpose of searching and presenting meals. Users possess the capability to conduct meal searches and subsequently include them within their personal favorites list. Furthermore, the application encompasses a dedicated meal detail page, enabling users to access comprehensive information pertaining to a specific meal.
# Features
  Homepage
    Utilize the API to conduct a search for any meal and exhibit the search outcomes on the frontend (the search results should dynamically update as you type).
    Each search result for a meal should include a favorite button, which, upon clicking, will add the meal to the "My favorite meals" list.
    Upon selecting a specific search result (any meal), navigate to a new page that provides comprehensive information about that meal (meal page).
# Meal Detail Page
    The page should exhibit pertinent information regarding the meal, such as its name, photograph, instructions, and other relevant details. 
    The page titled "My Favourite Meals" should showcase a comprehensive list of all the preferred meals. 
    It is imperative that this list remains persistent, retaining the same number of meals even after the browser is closed or refreshed. 
    Each meal on the list should feature a "Remove from Favourites" button, which, upon clicking, will eliminate the respective meal from the list.
